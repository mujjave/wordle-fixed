# wordle-fixed
wordle fixed files


This is my wordle project with tkinter for submission.

It is similar to the NYT version of the wordle and I have also provided a list of words , where you submit from these words list.

The game lets you guess a five letter word, in six attempts, and proivdes color coded feedback the same as that of NYT' version. Green is correct , yellow indicates rearrangement and gray is not in the word. 

Enjoy
